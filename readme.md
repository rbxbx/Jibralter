Jibraltar
=========

Nothing to see here, move along...

Well, if you must stay, you should know that Jibraltar is simply a rough port
of [Tiddlylisp](https://github.com/mnielsen/tiddlylisp) which is in turn a
rough port of [Lis.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) written in (somewhat)
idiomatic [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) with a hearty assist from
[Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/).

It might even work some day.
